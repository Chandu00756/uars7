# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers of the UARS-7 platform pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behavior Examples

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- **Respectful Communication**: Using welcoming and inclusive language
- **Constructive Feedback**: Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- **Graceful Acceptance**: Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- **Community Focus**: Focusing on what is best for the community
- **Empathy**: Showing empathy towards other community members
- **Professional Conduct**: Maintaining professional behavior in all interactions
- **Security Mindset**: Prioritizing security and responsible disclosure practices

### Unacceptable Behavior Examples

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- **Harassment**: The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- **Trolling**: Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- **Privacy Violations**: Publishing others' private information without explicit permission

- **Security Violations**: Attempting to exploit security vulnerabilities for malicious purposes
- **Spam**: Posting irrelevant or promotional content repeatedly

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include:

- Using an official project email address
- Posting via an official social media account
- Acting as an appointed representative at online or offline events
- Contributing to project repositories
- Participating in project discussions, forums, or chat channels

## Security and Responsible Disclosure

Given the security-focused nature of UARS-7, we have additional expectations:

### Security Research Ethics

- **Responsible Disclosure**: Report security vulnerabilities through proper channels
- **No Malicious Testing**: Do not perform security testing on production systems without explicit permission
- **Data Protection**: Respect user data and privacy during security research
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure all security research complies with applicable laws

### Information Sharing

- **Confidentiality**: Respect confidential information shared during collaboration
- **Attribution**: Properly attribute security research and findings
- **Coordination**: Coordinate with maintainers before public disclosure of security issues

## Enforcement

### Reporting Process

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**Email**: [conduct@portalvii.com](mailto:conduct@portalvii.com)

### Report Contents

When reporting, please include:

- Your contact information
- Names (real, usernames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
- Your account of what occurred
- Additional context you believe might be helpful
- Screenshots or logs (if applicable)

### Response Timeline

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Appeals Process

If you believe you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the project team with a concise description of your grievance. Appeals will be handled by a different set of community leaders than those involved in the original enforcement action.

### Appeal Timeline

- **Submission**: Within 30 days of the enforcement action
- **Review**: 2-4 weeks for appeal review
- **Decision**: Final decision within 6 weeks

## Special Considerations for Security

### Security-Related Violations

Given the sensitive nature of security work in UARS-7:

- **Immediate Action**: Security violations may result in immediate temporary restrictions
- **Legal Consultation**: Serious security violations may require legal review
- **Coordinated Response**: May involve coordination with external security teams
- **Documentation**: Enhanced documentation requirements for security-related incidents

### Protection of Security Researchers

We are committed to protecting legitimate security researchers:

- **Good Faith Protection**: Good faith security research will not result in enforcement action
- **Safe Harbor**: Responsible disclosure following our security policy is encouraged
- **Credit and Recognition**: Proper attribution for security contributions
- **Privacy Protection**: Security researcher identity protection when requested
